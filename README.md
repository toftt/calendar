## How to use Spotify Christmas Calendar?
### To create a calendar:
 1. Add different songs for each day by searching from the search bar
 2. If you can not end up with 24 songs, don't worry we are here for you! Ask for recommendations with the "Recommended Autofill" button at the bottom of the page. We will complete the rest of the remaining days for you based on the songs you added recently :)
 3. Press "Share Calendar" button to share your calendar using the link generated with your friends/family to wish them "Merry Christmas!"
 
### To listen a calendar:
  1. Go to the url shared with you
  2. Do not forget one song for each day! So, you can not open the song box before the day comes. Be patient!
  3. You can play/pause songs by clicking on the song and using Play/Pause button on the opening song card.
  4. If you think the songs should be on your Spotify, just click on the Add button and the song will be added to a playlist called "Spotify Christmas Calendar Playlist" created for you, of course with love.
  5. Enjoy with your calendar!
